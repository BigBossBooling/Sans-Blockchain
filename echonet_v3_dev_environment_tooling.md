# EchoNet v3 - Conceptual Development Environment & Tooling Stack

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the conceptual development environment and tooling stack envisioned for building the EchoNet v3 platform. The choices aim to support the platform's decentralized nature, promote efficient development practices, align with the CI/CD strategy (`echonet_v3_cicd_strategy.md`), and facilitate collaboration.

This is a living document and choices may be refined as development (especially for Phase 0-1 of the `echonet_v3_implementation_roadmap_conceptual.md`) progresses.

## 2. Core Principles for Tooling Selection

*   **Open Source Preference:** Prioritize open-source tools where feasible to align with the decentralized ethos and reduce vendor lock-in.
*   **Community Support & Maturity:** Select tools with strong community backing, good documentation, and proven stability.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Choose tools that can handle the anticipated scale and performance requirements of EchoNet.
*   **Developer Experience:** Opt for tools that enhance developer productivity and satisfaction.
*   **Interoperability:** Ensure tools can integrate well within the overall stack.

## 3. Programming Languages

*   **Primary Backend Language (DLI Nodes, Core Services): Go**
    *   **Rationale:** Excellent for concurrent programming (goroutines, channels), strong networking libraries, fast compilation, statically typed, good performance, and a growing ecosystem for distributed systems. Aligns well with needs of DLI nodes (Witnesses, DDS) and core API services.
*   **Smart Contracts / DLI-Native Logic: TBD (Potentially a specialized DSL or embedded interpreter)**
    *   **Rationale:** While EchoNet is "sans-blockchain" in the traditional sense, the DLI-native logic for monetization (as per `direct_monetization_refined.md`) needs a secure and verifiable execution environment.
    *   **Options:**
        *   **WebAssembly (WASM):** Could compile from languages like Rust, C++, or AssemblyScript. Offers sandboxing and performance.
        *   **Embedded Scripting Language:** Lua or a similar lightweight, sandboxed scripting language.
        *   **Custom DSL:** A domain-specific language designed for EchoNet's specific contract needs (more complex to develop but potentially safer).
    *   *Further research in Phase 0 is needed here.*
*   **Client-Side SDKs & Frontend (Reference/Example): JavaScript/TypeScript**
    *   **Rationale:** Ubiquitous for web frontends. TypeScript adds static typing for better maintainability. SDKs would provide libraries for interacting with EchoNet from various environments.
*   **Tooling & Scripts: Python, Bash**
    *   **Rationale:** Python for general scripting, automation, data analysis (e.g., tokenomic simulations). Bash for system-level scripting and CI/CD automation.

## 4. Development Environment

*   **Containerization: Docker**
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent development and testing environments across different machines. Simplifies dependency management and deployment. Docker Compose for managing multi-container local environments.
*   **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Developer choice, with strong support for Go and TypeScript/JavaScript.
    *   **Examples:** VS Code (with relevant Go/Docker/Proto extensions), GoLand.
*   **Version Control: Git**
    *   **Rationale:** Standard for collaborative software development.
    *   **Hosting:** GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted equivalent.

## 5. Communication & Data Exchange

*   **Inter-Service Communication (RPC): gRPC with Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**
    *   **Rationale:** As specified in `echonet_v3_communication_protocols.md`. High-performance, language-agnostic, well-defined interfaces, supports streaming. Protobuf for efficient data serialization.
*   **Asynchronous Messaging (Event Bus - Conceptual): Apache Kafka or NATS.io**
    *   **Rationale:** For decoupled communication between services where appropriate (e.g., broadcasting validated events, notifications). Kafka offers high throughput and persistence. NATS is lighter and very fast. Selection depends on specific needs.
*   **APIs for Client SDKs: gRPC-Web, REST/HTTP (with OpenAPI specification)**
    *   **Rationale:** gRPC-Web to allow browser clients to interact with gRPC services. REST/HTTP as a fallback or for simpler public APIs, defined with OpenAPI for clarity and tooling.

## 6. Data Storage (Beyond Core DDS)

*   **Configuration Data/Service Discovery (Internal): etcd or Consul**
    *   **Rationale:** For managing configuration of DLI nodes and services, and for internal service discovery, especially in a clustered environment.
*   **Caching: Redis or Memcached**
    *   **Rationale:** For caching frequently accessed data to improve performance of application-layer services.
*   **Local Node Storage (DDS/Witness): Embedded Key-Value Store (e.g., BadgerDB, RocksDB) or Filesystem**
    *   **Rationale:** Efficient local storage for DLI node data, indexes, and content chunks before replication.

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance

*   **Unit Testing:** Native Go testing libraries, Jest/Mocha for TypeScript/JavaScript.
*   **Integration Testing:** Go testing frameworks, Docker Compose for setting up test environments.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Frameworks like Playwright or Cypress for testing user-facing applications.
*   **Performance Testing:** Tools like k6, JMeter, or custom Go applications.
*   **Static Analysis & Linting:**
    *   Go: `go vet`, `golint`, `staticcheck`.
    *   TypeScript/JavaScript: ESLint, Prettier.
    *   Protobuf: `buf` linter.
*   **Code Coverage:** Standard Go tools, Istanbul/nyc for JavaScript/TypeScript.

## 8. CI/CD & Automation

*   **CI/CD Platform:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions (as per `echonet_v3_cicd_strategy.md`).
    *   **Rationale:** Automate building, testing, and deployment pipelines.
*   **Build Automation:** Makefiles, Go build tools, npm/yarn scripts.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC - for testnets/mainnet): Terraform, Ansible**
    *   **Rationale:** For managing and provisioning cloud infrastructure reproducibly.

## 9. Observability

*   **Logging:** Structured logging libraries (e.g., `slog` for Go). Centralized logging system (ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or Grafana Loki). (Aligned with `echonet_v3_logging_metrics_strategy.md` if that document is created).
*   **Metrics:** Prometheus client libraries for Go. Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting.
*   **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing to understand request flows across services.
*   **Visualization & Dashboards: Grafana**
    *   **Rationale:** For visualizing logs, metrics, and traces.

## 10. Project Management & Collaboration

*   **Issue Tracking:** Jira, GitLab Issues, GitHub Issues.
*   **Documentation Platform:**
    *   Technical/Architectural Docs: Markdown files in Git repository (current approach).
    *   API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI UI, Go doc.
    *   User Guides: Dedicated platform like GitBook, ReadtheDocs, or a wiki. (Aligned with `echonet_v3_documentation_strategy.md`).
*   **Communication:** Slack, Discord, or Mattermost for team communication. Dedicated forum (Discourse) for community discussions.

## 11. Security Tooling

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Tools specific to Go (e.g., gosec) and JavaScript.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (for web-facing components).
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Tools like `nancy` (Go), npm audit/yarn audit, Snyk, Dependabot.
*   **Secrets Management:** HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider KMS.

This conceptual stack provides a robust foundation for developing EchoNet. Specific tool choices within categories can be finalized during Phase 0 based on further evaluation and team expertise.
