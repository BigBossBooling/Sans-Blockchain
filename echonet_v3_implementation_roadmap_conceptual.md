# EchoNet v3 - Conceptual Implementation Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a conceptual, high-level implementation roadmap for the EchoNet v3 platform. It translates the comprehensive v3 architecture (detailed in `echonet_v3_unified_architecture_overview.md` and its constituent documents) into a phased approach for development and deployment.

This roadmap is iterative and will be refined as development progresses and community feedback is incorporated. It prioritizes building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for core functionalities first, followed by progressive enhancements and decentralization.

## 2. Guiding Principles for Implementation

*   **Iterative Development:** Build, test, and release features incrementally.
*   **Core Functionality First:** Focus on establishing the DLI backbone and essential user-facing features.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security practices throughout the development lifecycle.
*   **Community Involvement:** Seek feedback and contributions from the community at various stages.
*   **Progressive Decentralization:** Gradually shift control and operations to decentralized mechanisms as per the `echonet_v3_governance_model.md`.
