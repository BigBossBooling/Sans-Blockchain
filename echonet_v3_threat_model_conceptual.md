**EchoNet Conceptual Threat Model (v3.0)**

This document outlines a conceptual threat model for the `EchoNet` system. It identifies key assets, potential attackers and their motivations, and plausible attack vectors against various components of the `EchoNet` DLI and application layers. This model is guided by the "Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution" aspect of the Expanded KISS Principle and aims to inform ongoing design and security efforts.

**1. Threat Modeling Goals for `EchoNet`**

*   **Identify & Categorize Potential Threats:** Systematically identify potential threats to `EchoNet`'s assets and categorize them (e.g., using STRIDE).
*   **Inform Defensive Design:** Use the identified threats to guide the design and refinement of security controls and architectural choices.
*   **Prioritize Security Efforts:** Help prioritize security resources and development effort by understanding the potential impact and likelihood of different threats (though formal risk assessment is a later step).
*   **Raise Security Awareness:** Foster a security-conscious mindset within the development and operational teams.

**2. Key Assets to Protect**

*   **A. Data Integrity:**
    *   **Content Immutability:** Ensuring that published content (`ContentObject` identified by `ContentID`) cannot be altered after validation.
    *   **DLI State Correctness:** Accuracy of PoE scores, ad campaign budgets, creator payout balances, user reputation scores, and other state managed by DLI-native "contracts."
    *   **Transaction Validity:** Ensuring only valid and authorized transactions modify the DLI state.
*   **B. Data & Service Availability:**
    *   **Content Retrievability:** Ensuring content stored on DDS remains accessible to authorized users.
    *   **`EchoNet` Core Services:** Availability of Witness Validation, Discovery Protocol (DHT), DLI-native contract operations, and other critical network functions.
*   **C. User Identity, Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   **DID Integrity:** Preventing theft or unauthorized use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).
    *   **Action Authorization:** Ensuring only authorized DIDs can perform specific actions (e.g., publishing content, spending funds, participating as a Witness).
*   **D. Monetary Value & Economic System:**
    *   **User Funds:** Security of tokens held in user wallets (though largely a client-side concern, the DLI must process transfers correctly).
    *   **System Pools:** Integrity of ad campaign budgets, creator payout pools, and PoE reward pools managed by DLI-native contracts.
    *   **Fairness of Monetization:** Preventing gaming of the ad system, PoE rewards, or creator payouts.
*   **E. Reputation System Integrity:**
    *   Preventing artificial inflation or deflation of user/node reputation scores.
    *   Ensuring reputation accurately reflects contributions and behavior.
*   **F. System Integrity & Consensus:**
    *   **DLI Consensus Robustness:** Preventing disruption or takeover of the Proof-of-Witness consensus mechanism.
    *   **Network Stability:** Resistance to large-scale partitioning or Sybil attacks.
*   **G. User Privacy (Where Designed):**
    *   Protecting user data that is intended to be private (e.g., encrypted drafts, potentially some interaction metadata if not fully public).
    *   Minimizing linkage between DIDs and real-world identities unless explicitly desired by the user.

**3. Potential Attackers & Motivations**

*   **A. Malicious Users (Internal/External):**
    *   **Motivations:** Financial gain (defrauding monetization, stealing from others if possible), censorship (unfairly flagging/downvoting), spamming, manipulating reputation/PoE for undue influence or rewards, de-platforming others.
    *   **Capabilities:** Standard user-level access, potentially using bots or scripts.
*   **B. Malicious Node Operators (SSNs, Witnesses, Indexers):**
    *   **Motivations:** Financial gain (e.g., falsely claiming storage for rewards, trying to validate fraudulent transactions), censorship (refusing to store/validate certain content/events), disrupting competitors, gaining undue influence in consensus.
    *   **Capabilities:** Control over one or more nodes; ability to modify node software (if not strictly enforced), collude with other malicious operators.
*   **C. Economically Motivated External Attackers:**
    *   **Motivations:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in DLI-native contracts for financial theft, gaming the PoE or ad system for profit, ransomware attacks against storage nodes.
    *   **Capabilities:** Technical expertise, botnets, potentially significant resources.
*   **D. Ideologically Motivated Attackers / Griefers:**
    *   **Motivations:** Disrupting the platform's operation, promoting specific narratives by spamming or manipulating content visibility, de-platforming users with opposing views, general mischief.
    *   **Capabilities:** Vary from simple spamming to more sophisticated disruption attempts.
*   **E. State-Level Actors / Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):**
    *   **Motivations:** Large-scale censorship, deanonymization of users, disruption of a platform seen as a threat, compromising the entire DLI's integrity.
    *   **Capabilities:** Extensive resources, sophisticated technical expertise, ability to conduct large-scale network attacks (BGP hijacking, DDoS), potentially compromise key infrastructure or software supply chains.

**4. Threat Categories & Example Attack Vectors (Conceptual - STRIDE Framework)**

*   **S - Spoofing Identity:**
    *   **Key Theft:** Compromising a user's or node's private keys to impersonate their DID (`echonet_v3_cryptographic_correctness_review.md` highlights key management).
        *   *Mitigation:* User education, hardware wallet support, robust client-side key security. Node operators securing their keys.
    *   **Fake/Sybil Nodes:** Creating numerous fake DIDs/nodes to try to influence reputation, PoE, or DHT routing.
        *   *Mitigation:* DID creation costs (even minimal), stake requirements for critical roles (Witness, SSN), reputation system to down-weight new/untrusted DIDs.
    *   **Impersonating Legitimate Services:** Setting up rogue DDS nodes that don't store data, or fake indexer nodes providing false information.
        *   *Mitigation:* Node Advertisement signatures, PoSR for DDS, cross-referencing discovery results.
    *   **RPC Request Forgery:** Sending RPC requests with a faked `sourceNodeID` in the header.
        *   *Mitigation:* Cryptographic signature (`CommonRequestHeader.signature`) on RPC requests authenticates the source.

*   **T - Tampering with Data:**
    *   **Content Modification (Post-Publication):** Attempting to alter `ContentObject` data after it has a `ContentID` and PoW Receipt.
        *   *Mitigation:* `ContentID` is a hash of content and core metadata. PoW Receipt signs this. Any tampering invalidates the `ContentID` or signature. DDS nodes verify chunk hashes.
    *   **DLI State Tampering:** Malicious Witnesses colluding to validate incorrect state transitions (e.g., fraudulent fund transfers, incorrect PoE score updates).
        *   *Mitigation:* M-of-N Witness consensus, staking/slashing for Witnesses, public auditability of DLI state changes and PoW Receipts.
    *   **Modifying RPC Messages In-Transit:** Altering data in RPC requests/responses between nodes.
        *   *Mitigation:* TLS encryption for all inter-node RPCs (`echonet_v3_communication_protocols.md`). Request/response signing if payload integrity beyond TLS is needed for specific critical RPCs.
    *   **DDS Data Corruption by Malicious SSN:** An SSN intentionally corrupts or deletes stored chunks.
        *   *Mitigation:* PoSR challenges by Witnesses. Replication/Erasure Coding allows data reconstruction from other SSNs. Reputation penalties/slashing for failing SSNs.
    *   **PoE/Ad Interaction Count Manipulation:** Users or bots generating fake views, clicks, or low-quality engagement to earn rewards or defraud advertisers.
        *   *Mitigation:* Rigorous input validation (`echonet_v3_input_validation_strategy.md`), Witness validation of interaction quality for PoE, reputation system, anti-gaming mechanisms in PoE module (`poe_rewards_refined.md`), ad fraud detection heuristics.

*   **R - Repudiation:**
    *   **Users Denying Actions:** A user claiming they did not publish specific content or make a particular interaction.
        *   *Mitigation:* All user-initiated actions (`ContentObject` submission, `InteractionEvent`) are signed with their DID's private key.
    *   **Witnesses Denying Attestations:** A Witness claiming they did not attest to a particular event.
        *   *Mitigation:* `WitnessAttestation` objects are signed by the Witness's DID.
    *   **SSNs Denying Storage Agreements (Conceptual):** An SSN denying it agreed to store a chunk.
        *   *Mitigation:* If explicit agreements are used, they would be signed. PoSR provides ongoing proof of storage.

*   **I - Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Leaking Encrypted Draft Content:** Compromise of a user's device or chosen DDS node storing their encrypted drafts, coupled with weak encryption or key compromise.
        *   *Mitigation:* User responsibility for key management; strong client-side encryption for drafts.
    *   **Deanonymizing Users:** Linking DIDs to real-world identities through analysis of public content metadata, interaction patterns, IP addresses (if not using privacy overlays like Tor/VPN), or side-channel attacks.
        *   *Mitigation:* Educating users on privacy best practices. `EchoNet` itself aims for pseudonymity via DIDs. Advanced privacy features (e.g., ZKPs for some actions) are future considerations.
    *   **Exposing Private DLI-Native Contract State:** If a contract's internal logic or state inadvertently reveals sensitive information.
        *   *Mitigation:* Careful design of DLI-native contracts to only make essential state public.
    *   **Compromise of TLS Keys:** Leading to interception of RPC traffic.
        *   *Mitigation:* Secure node key management, use of Perfect Forward Secrecy in TLS.

*   **D - Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):**
    *   **Flooding Attacks:**
        *   Overwhelming Witness nodes with event validation requests (e.g., spam content/interactions).
        *   Overwhelming DDS nodes (SSNs/ECNs) with storage or retrieval requests.
        *   Overwhelming DHT nodes with lookup or store requests.
        *   *Mitigation:* Rate limiting at RPC interfaces (`echonet_v3_communication_protocols.md`), reputation-based throttling, stake-based access tiers for some operations, input validation to reject malformed/spam requests quickly (`echonet_v3_input_validation_strategy.md`), efficient query processing.
    *   **DHT Routing/Eclipse Attacks:** Malicious nodes providing false routing information or isolating nodes from the main DHT.
        *   *Mitigation:* Kademlia's resilience features (e.g., parallel lookups, k-bucket refresh), connecting to diverse bootstrap nodes, node reputation.
    *   **Consensus Disruption:**
        *   A significant fraction of a Witness committee (>1/3 for Byzantine faults) being malicious or offline, preventing event validation.
        *   *Mitigation:* Random Witness selection, staking/slashing to disincentivize attacks, large pool of eligible Witnesses, monitoring network health to detect low participation.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion on Nodes:** Forcing nodes to consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk space.
        *   *Mitigation:* Strict limits on data sizes (content, metadata, interactions), efficient data structures and algorithms, input validation.

*   **E - Elevation of Privilege:**
    *   **Gaining Unauthorized Witness/Node Role:** An attacker managing to get their node selected as a Witness or registered as a trusted SSN without meeting staking/reputation criteria.
        *   *Mitigation:* Secure Witness/SSN registration process, DID-based authentication for role assumption, ongoing PoSR and performance monitoring.
    *   **Bypassing DLI-Native Contract Rules:** Exploiting a flaw in a DLI-native contract's logic to illegitimately claim rewards, release escrowed funds, or modify state.
        *   *Mitigation:* Rigorous auditing of DLI-native contract logic, formal verification (if feasible for critical parts), clear and simple logic, governance process for upgrades.
    *   **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities in Node Implementations:** A buffer overflow or similar vulnerability in a node's code allowing arbitrary code execution.
        *   *Mitigation:* Secure coding practices, SAST/DAST in CI/CD, dependency scanning, bug bounty programs, timely patching.

**5. Mapping Threats to `EchoNet` Components (High-Level Examples)**

*   **Proof-of-Witness Validation:** Consensus disruption, Witness spoofing/collusion, DoS via event flooding, tampering with PoW Receipts.
*   **Distributed Data Stores (DDS):** Data corruption/loss by malicious SSNs, DoS on storage/retrieval, availability attacks (taking many SSNs offline in a region), PoSR gaming.
*   **Discovery Protocol (DHT/Gossip):** Routing attacks, Sybil attacks on DHT, censorship by controlling DHT entries for specific `ContentID`s, DoS against DHT nodes.
*   **Monetization Modules (Direct Payouts, Ad Marketplace, PoE):** Economic exploits (gaming PoE scores, ad click fraud, exploiting payout logic), tampering with financial records/escrows, DoS against DLI-native contract functions.
*   **Engagement & Interaction Module:** Spamming (comments, reactions), reputation manipulation via fake interactions, unfair content flagging.
*   **Identity & Reputation System:** DID key theft, Sybil attacks to create fake reputations, targeted reputation attacks.

**6. Existing Mitigations (Conceptual - Based on v3 Design)**

*   **Cryptographic Primitives:** `ContentID`s for immutability, digital signatures (ED25519) for authenticity/non-repudiation, TLS for transport security. (Ref: `echonet_v3_cryptographic_correctness_review.md`)
*   **Canonicalization:** Ensures consistent hashing and signature verification. (Ref: `echonet_v3_canonical_data_formats.md`)
*   **Input Validation:** Strict validation at all API/message entry points. (Ref: `echonet_v3_input_validation_strategy.md`)
*   **Proof-of-Witness Consensus:** M-of-N attestations for event validity, random committee selection, staking/slashing for Witnesses. (Ref: `pow_witness_validation_refined.md`)
*   **Proof-of-Storage/Retrievability (PoSR):** Ensures DDS nodes are storing data correctly. (Ref: `dds_refined_architecture.md`)
*   **Replication & Erasure Coding:** Provides data durability and availability. (Ref: `replication_redundancy_refined.md`)
*   **Reputation System:** Disincentivizes malicious behavior and weights trusted actors more heavily. (Implicitly part of many modules, needs full definition).
*   **Rate Limiting & Resource Limits:** Conceptual controls against DoS.
*   **Batching & Asynchronous Processing:** Helps manage load for monetization and PoE.

**7. Areas Requiring Further Security Focus (Gaps & Reinforcements)**

*   **Robust Reputation System Design:** The details of the reputation calculation, update rules, and resistance to manipulation are critical and need full specification.
*   **Advanced Anti-Gaming for PoE & Ads:** While basic mechanisms are considered, sophisticated collusion and bot activity will require ongoing research and adaptive countermeasures (e.g., AI-based detection).
*   **DLI-Native "Contract" Security Audits:** The logic for Payouts, Ads, PoE, etc., even if not full smart contracts, needs rigorous auditing for economic exploits or unintended consequences.
*   **Formal Verification (for critical DLI logic):** Consider formal verification for core consensus rules or critical DLI-native contract state transitions if feasible.
*   **Privacy Enhancements:** For aspects like voting, private interactions, or mitigating metadata linkage, explore technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs, private information retrieval (PIR) for DDS, or more advanced DID communications (DIDComm v2).
*   **Governance Security:** The process for proposing, voting on, and enacting protocol upgrades must be secure against manipulation.
*   **Bootstrapping Security:** Ensuring new nodes connect to legitimate peers and obtain a trustworthy initial state of the DLI.
*   **Economic Security Analysis:** Deeper analysis of tokenomics, staking amounts, and reward/slashing parameters to ensure they effectively deter malicious economic activity.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** How the `EchoNet` community and developers would respond to a successful major attack or vulnerability disclosure.

This conceptual threat model provides a starting point. It should be a living document, revisited and updated as the `EchoNet` design becomes more detailed and as new potential threats emerge.
