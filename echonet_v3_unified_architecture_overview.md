**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a unified overview of the EchoNet Version 3.0 architecture. EchoNet is a decentralized blogging and social engagement platform designed to directly compensate creators for their content and engagement, and to offer a fair and transparent advertising model.

The v3 architecture represents a significant refinement and systematization of earlier conceptual models, emphasizing clarity, robustness, security, and scalability through KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles. It details the core components, their interactions, underlying DLI (Distributed Ledger Inspired) mechanisms, data structures, operational strategies, and governance.

This overview serves as a master guide, referencing the detailed individual v3 architectural documents that elaborate on specific aspects of the system.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Design Principles (Recap)

The EchoNet v3 design adheres to the following core principles:

*   **User Empowerment:** Prioritizing creators and users, ensuring fair compensation and control over data/identity.
*   **Decentralization:** Distributing control and eliminating single points of failure or censorship.
*   **Transparency:** Making operations, rules, and financial flows auditable and understandable.
*   **Simplicity (KISS):** Favoring straightforward solutions to complex problems for robustness and maintainability.
*   **Modularity:** Designing components with clear responsibilities and interfaces.
*   **Security:** Integrating security considerations at all levels of the design.
