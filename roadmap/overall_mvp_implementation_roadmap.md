# DigiSocialBlock (EchoNet Protocol) - Overall MVP Implementation Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-28 (Placeholder - will be updated by actual generation date)

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the Overall Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Implementation Roadmap for the DigiSocialBlock platform, underpinned by the EchoNet DLI (Distributed Ledger Inspired) protocol. It synthesizes the detailed MVP plans for three foundational modules:

1.  **Module 1: Core DLI Functionality** (from `implementation_plans/dli_core_mvp_plan.md`)
2.  **Module 2: Identity & Privacy Features** (from `implementation_plans/identity_privacy_mvp_plan.md`)
3.  **Module 3: Content Validation & Incentives (Initial PoE & AI Stubs)** (from `implementation_plans/content_validation_mvp_plan.md`)

This roadmap aims to provide a coherent, phased approach to developing and integrating these core components to achieve a demonstrable and valuable initial version of the EchoNet platform.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this Overall MVP Implementation Roadmap is to:

*   Outline the **sequencing** of development efforts across the different MVP modules.
*   Identify key **dependencies** between tasks and modules.
*   Define overarching **milestones** for the MVP development lifecycle.
*   Reiterate common **development practices and principles** (e.g., technology stack choices, testing strategies, CI/CD) that apply to the entire MVP effort.
*   Serve as the **master guide** for the initial implementation phase, ensuring all development streams align towards a unified MVP launch.
*   Provide a basis for future, more detailed sprint planning and resource allocation.

This document will be updated as development progresses and new insights are gained.

## 3. Core Principles & Assumptions for MVP Development

This section outlines the foundational principles and key assumptions that will guide the development of the EchoNet MVP.

### 3.1. Guiding Philosophy

The primary guiding philosophy for the EchoNet MVP development is the **Expanded KISS Principle**, as articulated in earlier project documentation:

*   **K - Know Your Core, Keep it Clear:**
    *   *Relevance to MVP:* Focus on the absolute essential functionalities of the DLI, identity, and consent mechanisms. Avoid feature creep. Ensure each component has a well-defined purpose and interface. This clarity is crucial for building a stable foundation.
*   **I - Iterate Intelligently, Integrate Intuitively:**
    *   *Relevance to MVP:* The MVP itself is the first major iteration. Subsequent features will build upon it. Integration between the MVDLI core, Identity/Privacy MVP, and Content Validation MVP must be planned for smooth, intuitive interactions between these modules from the outset.
*   **S - Systematize for Scalability, Synchronize for Synergy:**
    *   *Relevance to MVP:* While full scalability is a post-MVP concern, the initial system design (e.g., choice of Go, libp2p, Protobufs) should not preclude future scalability. Core components must synchronize effectively (e.g., DIDs used by PoE, consent records linked to DIDs).
*   **S - Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution:**
    *   *Relevance to MVP:* Implement foundational security practices from the start (e.g., secure key management for DIDs, signature validation for DLI events). While comprehensive security hardening is post-MVP, basic vulnerabilities should be addressed. Understand the landscape of decentralized applications and potential attack vectors.
*   **S - Stimulate Engagement, Sustain Impact (The Authentic Connection):**
    *   *Relevance to MVP:* For the MVP, this means ensuring the core functionalities are usable and demonstrate tangible value (e.g., a user can create an identity, publish a piece of content, and see it validated and stored). This initial positive feedback loop is vital for sustaining development momentum and future community engagement.

Adherence to these principles will help ensure the MVP is robust, focused, and provides a solid groundwork for the full EchoNet vision.

### 3.2. Key Assumptions

The development of the EchoNet MVP operates under the following key assumptions:

*   **Technical Foundation:**
    *   The MVP will be built upon the EchoNet v3.0 conceptual architecture and the detailed technical specifications outlined in the `tech_specs/*.md` documents (covering DLI core data structures, DDS protocol, PoW protocol, content hashing/timestamping, mobile node considerations, DID method, data consent protocol, PoE protocol, and AI/ML integration points).
*   **Technology Stack (Conceptual - for MVDLI and initial modules):**
    *   **Primary Language for DLI Core & P2P Networking:** Go (Golang), chosen for its concurrency features, performance, and strong ecosystem for P2P systems.
    *   **P2P Networking Library:** go-libp2p, for its modularity and comprehensive P2P capabilities.
    *   **Data Serialization:** Protocol Buffers v3 (Protobuf3), for efficient, typed, and Ã©volvable data structures.
    *   **Node-Local State Database:** An embedded key-value store such as BadgerDB or LevelDB (via Go bindings), for managing local node state efficiently.
    *   **Performance-Critical Components (Future Option):** Rust may be considered for specific performance-critical cryptographic components or highly optimized consensus logic post-MVP, potentially integrated via FFI if Go performance proves insufficient in targeted areas.
*   **Resource Availability (Conceptual):**
    *   It is assumed that a development team with the necessary skills in Go, distributed systems, P2P networking, cryptography, and the specific libraries (libp2p, Protobufs) will be available. (Specific team size, roles, and funding are outside the scope of this technical roadmap but are critical project management considerations).
*   **MVP Scope Adherence:**
    *   Development efforts will strictly focus on the features and functionalities defined within the scope of the three integrated MVP plans (`dli_core_mvp_plan.md`, `identity_privacy_mvp_plan.md`, `content_validation_mvp_plan.md`). More advanced features, optimizations, and full-scale implementations will be deferred to post-MVP iterations.
*   **Iterative Development:**
    *   The overall MVP is the first major deliverable in a series of iterative development cycles. Feedback gathered from testing and deploying the MVP will be crucial for refining existing features and prioritizing future development.
*   **CI/CD & Testing Practices:**
    *   Development will adhere to the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategy outlined in `echonet_v3_cicd_strategy.md` from the beginning. This includes automated builds, linting, and unit testing.
    *   Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices will be strongly encouraged for all new code to ensure quality and maintainability.
    *   A simulated network environment will be used extensively for integration testing of P2P interactions and DLI functionalities.

## 4. Module Sequencing & Dependencies

This section outlines the proposed sequence for implementing the core modules of the EchoNet MVP, highlighting key dependencies between them. The goal is to build a stable foundation first, then layer additional functionalities.

### 4.1. Foundational DLI Layer Implementation Sequence (Module 1 MVP)

The implementation of the MVDLI core (as detailed in `implementation_plans/dli_core_mvp_plan.md`) must follow a strict sequence due to inherent dependencies. This ensures that foundational components are in place before dependent systems are built.

*   **1. Core Data Structure Implementation (`tech_specs/dli_core_data_structures.md`)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement the Protocol Buffer definitions (or chosen language equivalents, e.g., Go structs generated from `.proto` files) for `NexusContentObjectV1`, `CoreContentMetadataV1`, `NexusUserObjectV1` (basic form), `NexusInteractionRecordV1` (basic form), `WitnessProofV1` (basic form), and `DDSChunk`.
    *   **Rationale:** These data structures are the "nouns" of the EchoNet DLI. All other components will create, consume, or manipulate these structures. Their precise implementation is a prerequisite for any further development.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Implemented and unit-tested data structure libraries, including serialization and deserialization logic.
*   **2. Content Hashing & Timestamping Logic (`tech_specs/content_hashing_timestamping_specs.md`)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement the canonicalization procedures and hashing algorithms (SHA-256) for generating `ContentID`s (for `NexusContentObjectV1`), `core_metadata_hash` (for `CoreContentMetadataV1`), and `chunk_id`s (for `DDSChunk`s). Implement logic for handling client-asserted timestamps and preparing for network-validated timestamps.
    *   **Rationale:** Essential for data integrity, uniqueness, and content-addressability before any storage, validation, or retrieval operations can be meaningfully performed. Depends on Step 1 (Core Data Structures).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Verified hashing utilities and timestamp handling functions.
*   **3. Basic P2P Networking Layer Setup (from `implementation_plans/dli_core_mvp_plan.md`)**
    *   **Focus:** Initialize go-libp2p host, establish node identity (using basic key pairs), implement peer discovery (e.g., bootstrap lists, mDNS for local networks), and set up basic pub/sub topics for event gossip.
    *   **Rationale:** Forms the communication backbone for all inter-node interactions required by subsequent DDS, PoW, and Discovery components. Depends on basic understanding of data to be gossiped (conceptual from Step 1).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Functional P2P layer where nodes can connect, discover each other (locally or via bootstrap), and exchange basic messages via pub/sub.
*   **4. Rudimentary Distributed Data Stores (DDS) Protocol Implementation (`tech_specs/dds_protocol.md` & MVDLI plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement basic `StoreChunk` and `RetrieveChunk` RPCs and logic for MVDLI SSN nodes (e.g., in-memory or simple file-per-chunk storage). Implement client-side logic to interact with these RPCs.
    *   **Rationale:** Content chunks need to be stored before they can be referenced by `NexusContentObjectV1` metadata, validated by PoW, or discovered. Depends on Step 1 (for `DDSChunk` structure), Step 2 (for `chunk_id`s), and Step 3 (for RPC communication).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** MVDLI SSN nodes capable of storing and serving chunks; client logic to put/get chunks.
*   **5. Rudimentary Proof-of-Witness (PoW) Protocol Implementation (`tech_specs/pow_protocol.md` & MVDLI plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement logic for a simplified committee (e.g., fixed initial Witnesses). Implement DLI event submission (e.g., for new `NexusContentObjectV1` metadata), basic validation (schema checks, signature verification - preliminary, as full DID logic is Module 2), attestation generation by Witnesses, and `WitnessProofV1` assembly (using a list of individual signatures for MVP).
    *   **Rationale:** This is the core consensus mechanism that validates DLI events. It depends on Step 1 (for event/proof structures), Step 2 (for validating `ContentID`s, timestamps), and Step 3 (for event and attestation gossip). It also conceptually depends on Step 4 (as Witnesses might need to verify that content chunks referenced in an object are available on DDS).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Witnesses able to receive content objects, perform basic validation, and generate a basic `WitnessProofV1`.
*   **6. Basic Discovery Protocol (DHT) Implementation (from `discovery_protocol_refined.md` & MVDLI plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement basic Kademlia DHT `STORE_VALUE` (e.g., `ContentID` -> MVDLI SSN address; `ChunkID` -> MVDLI SSN address) and `FIND_VALUE` operations using go-libp2p's Kademlia DHT implementation.
    *   **Rationale:** Makes content and DDS storage locations discoverable across the network. Depends on Step 3 (P2P layer for DHT to operate), Step 4 (to know which SSN addresses host which chunks/content), and conceptually Step 5 (as proofs might also be made discoverable).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Nodes can publish and resolve key-value pairs in the rudimentary DHT, specifically for content/chunk locations.
*   **7. Initial Mobile Node Roles (Host Functionality - `tech_specs/mobile_node_specifications.md` & MVDLI plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement client-side logic for a "Host" role (conceptualized for a CLI or test application initially, rather than a full mobile app for MVDLI). This includes creating a `NexusContentObjectV1` with its chunks, submitting chunks to MVDLI SSNs, submitting the content object for PoW validation, and then being able to retrieve it via the Discovery protocol and DDS.
    *   **Rationale:** Validates the end-to-end usability and integration of all preceding MVDLI components from the perspective of a primary user agent. This ensures the DLI core is not just internally functional but can serve its intended purpose. Depends on all preceding DLI components (Steps 1-6) being minimally functional.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** A test client or CLI tool capable of publishing a piece of content to the MVDLI and retrieving it, demonstrating the full lifecycle.

This sequence prioritizes building the system from the ground up, ensuring foundational layers are stable before more complex logic is introduced.

### 4.2. Identity & Privacy Integration Sequence (Module 2 MVP)

Once the Foundational DLI Layer (Module 1 MVP) is operational and stable, the Identity & Privacy features (as detailed in `implementation_plans/identity_privacy_mvp_plan.md`) can be integrated. This module critically depends on the MVDLI's ability to process and validate DLI events, store data, and make it discoverable.

*   **1. `did:echonet` Library/SDK Functions (Client-Side - Task 2.1 from Identity MVP Plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement client-side logic for Ed25519 key pair generation, derivation of `did:echonet` strings from public keys, construction of basic `NexusDIDDocumentV1` protobuf messages, and functions for signing data and verifying signatures.
    *   **Rationale:** These are foundational client-side tools necessary for any DID operations, preparing for interaction with the DLI. This step has minimal direct DLI dependency for the library functions themselves but is a prerequisite for DLI interactions.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** A functional client-side library (e.g., Go package) for `did:echonet` operations.
*   **2. DID Registration on MVDLI (Task 2.2 from Identity MVP Plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Develop the client logic to create a "DID Registration" DLI event (containing the `NexusDIDDocumentV1`, signed by the initial authentication key). Extend MVDLI Witness PoW validation to handle this new event type (basic schema, signature checks). Integrate with MVDLI DDS to store the `NexusDIDDocumentV1` and with MVDLI Discovery (DHT) to publish the `did -> ContentID_of_DID_Doc` mapping.
    *   **Rationale:** This activates DIDs on the EchoNet DLI, making them resolvable and usable. Directly depends on a functional MVDLI (P2P for event gossip, PoW for validation, DDS for storage, Discovery for resolution mapping).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** DID registration process operational on the MVDLI; DIDs can be created and their documents stored and mapped.
*   **3. DID Resolution via MVDLI (Task 2.3 from Identity MVP Plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement client-side resolver functions that query the MVDLI Discovery (DHT) for a DID Document's `ContentID` and then retrieve the document from the MVDLI DDS.
    *   **Rationale:** Enables any participant to retrieve DID Documents, which is essential for verifying signatures and discovering service endpoints. Depends on successful DID registration (Step 2 of this sequence) and the underlying MVDLI Discovery and DDS components.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** DID resolution functional; clients can fetch DID Documents from the MVDLI.
*   **4. Basic `NexusUserObjectV1` Creation & Linking (Task 2.4 from Identity MVP Plan)**
    *   **Focus:** As part of the DID Registration DLI event processing, create and store a minimal `NexusUserObjectV1` on the MVDLI DDS. This object will contain the `user_did`, `registration_timestamp`, and a link to/from the `NexusDIDDocumentV1` (e.g., `nexus_user_object_ref` in DID Doc, `did_document_ref` in User Object).
    *   **Rationale:** Establishes the core on-DLI anchor for user-specific attributes beyond the DID Document (like future reputation). Depends on DID registration (Step 2).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** `NexusUserObjectV1` instances created and linked with new DIDs, stored on DDS.
*   **5. Data Consent Grant/Revoke DLI Events (Client-Side & MVDLI Basic Validation - Task 2.5 from Identity MVP Plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Implement client-side logic to construct and sign `NexusConsentRecordV1` messages for granting and revoking consent. Develop "ConsentGrant" and "ConsentRevoke" DLI event types and extend MVDLI Witness PoW validation to perform basic checks on these events (valid signatures, recognized DIDs, basic structure).
    *   **Rationale:** Enables the core actions of the data consent protocol. Depends on registered DIDs (Step 2) for `grantor_did` and `grantee_did`.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Client can create and submit consent grant/revoke DLI events; MVDLI Witnesses perform basic validation.
*   **6. Basic Consent Registry & Query (MVDLI - Task 2.6 from Identity MVP Plan)**
    *   **Focus:** Upon successful Witness validation of consent events, store the `NexusConsentRecordV1` on MVDLI DDS. Implement a rudimentary Consent Registry by using the MVDLI DHT to store mappings like `hash(grantor, grantee, category) -> status_and_ContentID_of_Record`. Develop a basic client-side query function for consent status.
    *   **Rationale:** Makes consent decisions verifiable and queryable by relevant parties. Depends on consent grant/revoke DLI event processing (Step 5) and MVDLI DDS/Discovery.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Consent records stored on DDS; basic consent status queryable via the rudimentary Consent Registry.

This sequence ensures that DID functionalities are established before building consent mechanisms that rely on these DIDs.

### 4.3. Content & Monetization Integration Sequence (Module 3 MVP)

With the DLI core and Identity/Privacy layers in place, the initial features for content validation (PoE) and conceptual monetization can be implemented, as detailed in `implementation_plans/content_validation_mvp_plan.md`. This module relies on users (DIDs) creating interactions that are then scored and may affect reputation or (conceptually) rewards.

*   **1. PoE-Eligible Interaction Processing (MVDLI Witness Logic - Task 3.1 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Extend MVDLI Witness logic to identify specific `NexusInteractionRecordV1` types (e.g., comments, predefined quality reactions) as PoE-eligible and route them for PoE scoring after basic DLI validation (schema, signature).
    *   **Rationale:** This is the entry point for the PoE system, filtering relevant interactions. Depends on MVDLI PoW (Module 1) for basic event validation and `NexusInteractionRecordV1` structure (Module 1). Actor DIDs (Module 2) are crucial for identifying who performed the interaction.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** MVDLI Witnesses can categorize incoming interactions and flag PoE-eligible ones for further processing.
*   **2. Basic PoE Quality Scoring Algorithm Implementation (Task 3.2 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Implement the simplified, deterministic PoE Quality Scoring algorithm within the Witness logic. Use fixed initial weights (conceptual `PoEScoreFactorsV1` stored in config or as DLI constants for MVP). Include basic anti-gaming checks (e.g., velocity limits per DID for PoE-triggering interactions).
    *   **Rationale:** This calculates the core "quality" or "value" metric for an interaction, which is fundamental to PoE. Depends on Step 1 of this sequence and the actor's `NexusUserObjectV1.reputationScore` (Module 2) as an input to the scoring.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Witnesses can calculate and assign a basic PoE Quality Score to eligible interactions and include it in the `WitnessProofV1`.
*   **3. `AIOracleService` Interface & Stub Implementation (Task 3.3 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Define the gRPC/RPC interface for the `AIOracleService` as specified in `tech_specs/ai_ml_integration_points.md`. Implement a stubbed version of this service that returns predefined/randomized scores for different types of inputs (content, interaction). No actual AI model implementation in this MVP step.
    *   **Rationale:** Establishes the contract for future AI/ML model integration without the immediate overhead of AI development. Allows PoE scoring logic to be built with AI signals in mind. Minimal direct DLI dependency for the stub itself, can be an independent mock service.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** A defined RPC interface for `AIOracleService` and a functional stub service that PoE logic can call.
*   **4. Integration of AIOracleService Stub into PoE Scoring (Task 3.4 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Modify the Witness PoE scoring logic (from Step 2 of this sequence) to make calls to the stubbed `AIOracleService` for relevant data (e.g., comment text). Incorporate the dummy AI signals returned by the stub as factors in the PoE Quality Score calculation.
    *   **Rationale:** Tests the complete pipeline for PoE scoring, including the hook for AI-derived signals, ensuring the data flow is correct. Depends on Step 2 (basic PoE scoring) and Step 3 (AIOracleService stub).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** PoE scoring algorithm within Witnesses now incorporates (dummy) AI signals from the stubbed oracle.
*   **5. Reputation Score Update (`NexusUserObjectV1` - Task 3.5 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Implement DLI-native logic (or extend Witness state modification capabilities post-consensus) to update the `NexusUserObjectV1.reputationScore` of the interacting user (actor DID) based on the validated PoE Quality Scores from their interactions. For MVP, this can be a direct update.
    *   **Rationale:** This closes the loop by connecting the quality of engagement back to the user's on-DLI reputation. Depends on PoE scoring (Step 2/4) and the existence and accessibility of `NexusUserObjectV1` (Module 2).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** `NexusUserObjectV1.reputationScore` is updated based on validated PoE activity.
*   **6. Rudimentary PoE Reward Pool & Distribution Logic (Logging - Task 3.6 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Implement DLI-native logic (e.g., as part of a periodic conceptual "epoch end" event) to iterate through recent `WitnessProofV1`s containing PoE scores. Calculate potential reward shares based on these scores and a conceptual, fixed reward pool amount for the period. **Log these calculated potential rewards to DLI state or node logs.** No actual token transfers occur in this MVP stage.
    *   **Rationale:** Demonstrates the economic feedback loop conceptually and allows for testing the reward calculation logic without requiring full tokenomics and wallet integration. Depends on PoE scoring (Step 2/4).
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Calculation of conceptual PoE rewards is performed and logged by the DLI.
*   **7. Client-Side Submission of PoE-Eligible Interactions (Task 3.7 from Content MVP Plan):**
    *   **Focus:** Extend the test client/CLI tool (from Module 1 MVP) to allow users to submit `NexusInteractionRecordV1` instances that are specifically intended for PoE processing (e.g., posting a comment, issuing a "quality reaction" to a piece of content).
    *   **Rationale:** Enables end-to-end testing of the PoE MVP flow, from user interaction submission through to Witness validation, scoring, reputation update, and conceptual reward logging. Depends on all preceding steps in this Module 3 sequence being testable.
    *   **Key Deliverable:** Test client/CLI can generate PoE-eligible interactions and submit them to the MVDLI.

This sequence builds the initial content validation and user incentive mechanisms on top of the established DLI and identity foundations.

### 4.4. Conceptual Visual Dependency Chart Outline

To provide a clear visual overview of the inter-task and inter-module dependencies outlined in sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, a dependency chart should be created. This section outlines what such a chart would represent.

*   **Purpose of the Visual Chart:**
    *   To offer an at-a-glance understanding of the development flow for the entire EchoNet MVP.
    *   To clearly illustrate which tasks must be completed before others can begin (dependencies).
    *   To help identify the critical path for development, ensuring resources can be prioritized effectively.
    *   To show potential parallel work streams where tasks do not have direct sequential dependencies.

*   **Recommended Chart Type (Conceptual):**
    *   A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** or a **PERT chart** would be suitable.
    *   Alternatively, a simpler **flowchart** or **swimlane diagram** (if wanting to also show team/responsibility areas) could be used, focusing on clear dependency lines.

*   **Key Elements to Include in the Chart:**
    *   **Nodes/Boxes:** Each major task or deliverable from the sequences defined in sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 (e.g., "M1_T1: Core Data Structures," "M2_T2: DID Registration," "M3_T4: AI Stub Integration"). Task numbering (Module_Task) should be used for clarity.
    *   **Arrows/Lines:** Clearly indicate dependencies between tasks. An arrow from Task A to Task B means Task A must be completed before Task B can start.
    *   **Critical Path:** Highlight the sequence of tasks that directly determines the minimum time required to complete the entire MVP.
    *   **Parallel Streams:** Visually group or arrange tasks that can be worked on concurrently. For example, client-side DID library development (M2_T1) can occur in parallel with some early MVDLI P2P setup (M1_T3).
    *   **Module Grouping:** Optionally, use color-coding or swimlanes to visually distinguish tasks belonging to Module 1 (DLI Core), Module 2 (Identity/Privacy), and Module 3 (Content/Monetization).

*   **Tooling for Actual Generation (Note):**
    *   The actual visual chart is not generated in this markdown document. It would be created using specialized diagramming software (e.g., Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio, diagrams.net / draw.io), project management tools with Gantt/PERT capabilities, or code-based diagramming tools like Mermaid.js (which can be embedded in markdown later). This section serves as the specification for *what* the chart should convey.

*   **Example Snippet of How a Dependency Might be Described for the Chart (Textual representation to inform chart creation):**
    *   **Task ID:** M2_T2
    *   **Task Name:** DID Registration on MVDLI
    *   **Depends On:** M1_T3 (Basic P2P), M1_T4 (Rudimentary DDS), M1_T5 (Rudimentary PoW), M1_T6 (Basic Discovery), M2_T1 (DID Lib/SDK)
    *   *(This indicates that M2_T2 cannot start until all listed M1 tasks and M2_T1 are substantially complete or their necessary interfaces are stable.)*

    *   **Task ID:** M3_T5
    *   **Task Name:** Reputation Score Update (`NexusUserObjectV1`)
    *   **Depends On:** M3_T2 (Basic PoE Scoring) OR M3_T4 (AI Stub Integration if AI signal directly impacts score), M2_T4 (Basic `NexusUserObjectV1` Creation)
    *   *(This shows dependencies within the same module and on a previous module.)*

This visual chart will be a valuable companion to the textual roadmap, aiding project managers, developers, and stakeholders in understanding the overall MVP implementation flow.

## 5. Consolidated Technology Stack Summary

This section reiterates the core technology choices for the EchoNet MVP, ensuring a consistent understanding across the development team. These choices are derived from the "Key Assumptions" (Section 3.2) and the `implementation_plans/dli_core_mvp_plan.md`.

*   **Primary Programming Language (DLI Core, Node Logic, Services):**
    *   **Go (Golang):** Chosen for its strong concurrency features (goroutines, channels), excellent networking libraries, performance characteristics suitable for P2P systems, and a mature ecosystem in the DLT space.
*   **P2P Networking Library:**
    *   **go-libp2p:** The Go implementation of the libp2p framework will be used for its modularity in handling transports, stream multiplexing, peer discovery (DHT, mDNS), NAT traversal, and secure communication channels.
*   **Data Serialization:**
    *   **Protocol Buffers v3 (Protobuf3):** Used for defining all core data structures, DLI events, and RPC message payloads. This ensures efficient binary serialization, strong typing, and cross-language compatibility (though Go is primary for MVP). `protoc-gen-go` will be used for Go code generation.
*   **Node-Local State Database (for individual DLI nodes):**
    *   **Embedded Key-Value Store:**
        *   **Primary Candidate:** BadgerDB (pure Go, transactional, optimized for SSDs).
        *   **Alternative:** LevelDB (via Go bindings like `goleveldb`).
    *   **Rationale:** Provides persistent storage for node-specific data (e.g., DHT routing tables, local indexes, configuration, temporary Witness sets for MVDLI) without requiring external database dependencies for each node.
*   **Cryptography:**
    *   Standard Go cryptographic libraries.
    *   Ed25519 for digital signatures (DIDs, attestations).
    *   SHA-256 for hashing (`ContentID`, `chunk_id`, etc.).
    *   (X25519 for key agreement if encrypted messaging features were in MVP scope, currently deferred).
*   **Client-Side Logic (for Test Client/CLI):**
    *   **Go (Golang):** The initial test client and CLI tool will be developed in Go to leverage the same core data structure libraries and P2P components directly.
*   **Future Considerations (Post-MVP):**
    *   **Rust:** May be evaluated for highly performance-critical cryptographic routines or specific consensus algorithm components if Go performance becomes a bottleneck in those isolated areas. Integration would likely be via FFI.

This stack is chosen to promote development efficiency, leverage mature ecosystems, and meet the performance and concurrency demands of a decentralized DLI system.

## 6. Overall MVP Progression: Milestones & Conceptual Timeline

This section defines high-level milestones for the overall EchoNet MVP, drawing from the key deliverables of each module sequence. It also provides a conceptual phasing for the development effort.

### 6.1. Summary of Key Module Deliverables & Overarching MVP Milestones

The detailed task deliverables are outlined in Section 4. Here, we group them into overarching milestones that represent significant demonstrable progress.

**Foundational DLI Layer Milestones (Module 1 MVP)**
*   **Milestone M1.A: Core Network & Storage Primitives Operational**
    *   Description: Basic P2P networking allows nodes to connect and exchange messages. Core data structures are implemented and serializable. Rudimentary DDS allows client-side storage and retrieval of individual content chunks on test SSN nodes. Basic content hashing (`ContentID`, `chunk_id`) is functional.
    *   Key Deliverables: Bootstrappable P2P network, implemented data structure libraries (Protobufs in Go), functional `StoreChunk`/`RetrieveChunk` on MVDLI SSNs, `ContentID` generation utilities.
    *   *Corresponds to completing approximately M1 tasks 1-4.*
*   **Milestone M1.B: End-to-End MVDLI Content Lifecycle Operational**
    *   Description: Simplified PoW validation is functional for basic content submission events. A basic `WitnessProofV1` is generated. Basic Kademlia DHT allows `ContentID` registration (mapping to SSN addresses) and lookup. The initial CLI/test client can publish a content object (metadata + chunks) and retrieve it by `ContentID` through the full MVDLI stack.
    *   Key Deliverables: Test content objects successfully published, validated by fixed Witnesses, stored on MVDLI DDS, and discovered/retrieved by `ContentID` via DHT and DDS. CLI tool demonstrates this full loop.
    *   *Corresponds to completing M1 tasks 5-7, building on M1.A.*

**Identity & Privacy Layer Milestones (Module 2 MVP)**
*   **Milestone M2.A: Decentralized ID (DID) Lifecycle Operational on MVDLI**
    *   Description: Users (via the test client/CLI) can generate `did:echonet` key pairs and DIDs. They can construct and register a `NexusDIDDocumentV1` with the MVDLI. These DID Documents can be resolved by any client via the MVDLI's Discovery (DHT) and DDS. A basic `NexusUserObjectV1` is created and linked to the DID on the DLI.
    *   Key Deliverables: Functional client-side DID generation library; DID registration DLI events validated by MVDLI Witnesses; DID Documents stored on DDS and resolvable via DHT; `NexusUserObjectV1` created and associated with DIDs.
    *   *Depends on M1.B. Corresponds to completing approximately M2 tasks 1-4.*
*   **Milestone M2.B: Basic Data Consent Mechanism Functional on MVDLI**
    *   Description: Users (via the test client/CLI) can grant and revoke a basic consent type (e.g., for a predefined `data_category_ref`) using a `NexusConsentRecordV1`. The status of this consent can be queried via the rudimentary Consent Registry (DHT-based).
    *   Key Deliverables: Consent grant/revoke DLI events validated by MVDLI Witnesses; `NexusConsentRecordV1`s stored on DDS; basic consent status queryable.
    *   *Depends on M2.A. Corresponds to completing M2 tasks 5-6.*

**Content & Monetization Layer Milestones (Module 3 MVP)**
*   **Milestone M3.A: Basic PoE Scoring & Reputation Update Functional**
    *   Description: PoE-eligible interactions (e.g., comments submitted via test client/CLI) are identified and processed by MVDLI Witnesses. Basic PoE Quality Scores are calculated using fixed factors and incorporating dummy signals from the stubbed `AIOracleService`. The `NexusUserObjectV1.reputationScore` of the interacting DID is updated based on these scores.
    *   Key Deliverables: Submitted interactions receive a PoE Quality Score in their `WitnessProofV1`; `NexusUserObjectV1.reputationScore` changes based on validated PoE activity; `AIOracleService` interface defined and stub operational.
    *   *Depends on M1.B and M2.A. Corresponds to completing approximately M3 tasks 1-5.*
*   **Milestone M3.B: Conceptual End-to-End PoE Reward Logging Operational**
    *   Description: The rudimentary PoE Reward Pool logic (non-token-based) can calculate and log potential reward distributions based on accumulated PoE Quality Scores over a test period. The test client/CLI can be used to generate interactions that feed into this process.
    *   Key Deliverables: Logged output demonstrating the conceptual reward calculation based on test interactions and their PoE scores.
    *   *Depends on M3.A. Corresponds to completing M3 tasks 6-7.*

**Overall EchoNet MVP v0.1 Completion:**
*   **Description:** All above milestones (M1.A, M1.B, M2.A, M2.B, M3.A, M3.B) are achieved. The system demonstrates a basic but complete end-to-end flow: user identity creation, content publication, content discovery, interaction with content, PoE scoring of interactions, reputation updates, and conceptual logging of rewards.
*   **Key Deliverables:** A functional, integrated DLI network running on test nodes with a CLI client capable of exercising all core MVP features. Comprehensive test suite and initial documentation.

### 6.2. Conceptual Phasing & Timeline

While specific calendar dates are subject to team size, velocity, and unforeseen challenges, a conceptual phasing helps visualize the MVP progression. We can define three main phases for the overall MVP development:

*   **Phase A: DLI Core Bootstrap (Focus: Milestones M1.A)**
    *   **Duration (Notional):** e.g., Sprints 0-3 / "Month 1-2"
    *   **Primary Activities:**
        *   Setup of development environment, CI/CD pipeline, code repositories.
        *   Implementation of core data structures (M1_T1) and hashing/timestamping logic (M1_T2).
        *   Establishment of basic P2P networking with go-libp2p (M1_T3).
        *   Implementation of rudimentary DDS `StoreChunk`/`RetrieveChunk` (M1_T4).
    *   **Goal:** Achieve a state where nodes can connect, exchange basic data, and store/retrieve content chunks reliably on individual MVDLI SSNs. Foundational libraries for data handling are stable.

*   **Phase B: MVDLI End-to-End Flow & Initial Identity (Focus: Milestones M1.B, M2.A)**
    *   **Duration (Notional):** e.g., Sprints 4-7 / "Month 2-4"
    *   **Primary Activities:**
        *   Implementation of rudimentary PoW protocol (M1_T5).
        *   Implementation of basic Discovery (DHT) for content (M1_T6).
        *   Development of the initial CLI/test client for content publishing/retrieval (M1_T7), achieving M1.B.
        *   Parallel development of client-side `did:echonet` library (M2_T1).
        *   Integration of DID Registration and Resolution with the now functional MVDLI (M2_T2, M2_T3).
        *   Basic `NexusUserObjectV1` creation (M2_T4), achieving M2.A.
    *   **Goal:** A fully operational MVDLI where content can be published, validated, stored, and discovered. Users can create and resolve DIDs on this MVDLI.

*   **Phase C: Integrating Privacy & Engagement Loops (Focus: Milestones M2.B, M3.A, M3.B)**
    *   **Duration (Notional):** e.g., Sprints 8-10 / "Month 4-5"
    *   **Primary Activities:**
        *   Implementation of Data Consent DLI events and basic Consent Registry (M2_T5, M2_T6), achieving M2.B.
        *   Development of PoE-eligible interaction processing and basic PoE Quality Scoring by Witnesses (M3_T1, M3_T2).
        *   Implementation of the `AIOracleService` interface and stub (M3_T3) and its integration into PoE scoring (M3_T4).
        *   Reputation score updates based on PoE (M3_T5), achieving M3.A.
        *   Rudimentary (logged) PoE reward distribution logic (M3_T6).
        *   Extension of CLI/test client for PoE interactions (M3_T7), achieving M3.B.
    *   **Goal:** Demonstrate the core mechanics of user consent, content engagement scoring, reputation updates, and the conceptual reward loop. This completes the overall MVP v0.1.

**Note on Parallelism:**
*   Client-side library work (e.g., M2_T1 for DID functions) can often start earlier, in parallel with foundational DLI P2P/DDS work, as long as data structure contracts are stable.
*   The `AIOracleService` stub (M3_T3) can be developed independently once its interface is agreed upon.

This phased approach allows for iterative testing and integration, ensuring each layer is functional before building more complex features on top. The notional durations are for illustrative purposes only and would be refined during actual project planning.

## 7. Unified Testing Strategy for MVP

A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and correctness of the EchoNet MVP. This strategy will encompass multiple levels of testing, applied throughout the development lifecycle, and aligns with the principles in `echonet_v3_cicd_strategy.md`.

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
    *   Development will be guided by TDD/BDD principles where applicable. Unit tests will be written before or concurrently with feature code to define and verify component behavior.
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Focus:** Verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, modules, and data structures in isolation.
    *   **Examples:** Testing canonicalization and hashing functions, data structure serialization/deserialization, signature generation/verification, individual RPC handlers (with mocks), PoE scoring formula logic.
    *   **Tools:** Standard Go testing package, `testify/assert` for assertions.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   **Focus:** Verify the interaction between different components within a single node or service, and between closely related DLI core modules.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Testing the flow from an RPC call to a DDS node through its internal logic to storage.
        *   Verifying that Witness PoW logic correctly processes and validates a DLI event using local data structures and cryptographic utilities.
        *   Ensuring the DID client library correctly interfaces with local key storage.
    *   **Tools:** Go testing package, potentially using in-memory versions of dependencies or mocks.
*   **Simulated Network Tests (Multi-Node):**
    *   **Focus:** Verify interactions between multiple DLI nodes in a controlled, simulated P2P network environment.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Testing P2P node discovery (mDNS, DHT bootstrap).
        *   Verifying event gossip and pub/sub mechanisms.
        *   Testing DDS chunk storage and retrieval across different nodes.
        *   Validating the PoW consensus flow with multiple Witnesses.
        *   Testing DHT PUT/GET operations for content and DID resolution.
        *   Simulating basic mobile host client interactions with network nodes.
    *   **Tools:** Libp2p's testing utilities (e.g., `p2p/tools/tester`), custom test harnesses using Docker to orchestrate multiple node instances.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   **Focus:** Verify complete user stories and functional flows from the perspective of an end-user (simulated via the CLI/test client for the MVP).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Full lifecycle: User generates DID -> Publishes content (text + chunks) -> Content is validated by Witnesses -> Content is stored on DDS -> Content is discoverable via DHT -> Another user resolves DID and retrieves content.
        *   User grants consent -> Service queries and verifies consent -> User revokes consent -> Service query reflects revocation.
        *   User posts a comment -> Comment gets PoE score -> User's reputation is updated (verified via query or log).
    *   **Tools:** The CLI/test client application developed as part of the MVDLI (Module 1, Task 7) will be the primary driver for E2E tests, with scripts automating command sequences and verifying outputs/ DLI state changes.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    *   The CI pipeline (as per `echonet_v3_cicd_strategy.md`) will automatically run linters, unit tests, and potentially some integration tests on every commit or pull request.
    *   Regular (e.g., nightly) automated runs of more comprehensive integration and simulated network tests.

This multi-layered testing approach aims to catch issues early, ensure components integrate correctly, and validate that the overall MVP meets its functional requirements.
